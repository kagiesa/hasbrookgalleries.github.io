	<p2> About the Work :: “Through creating artificial figures out of clay models, I generate dualities of human presence and simulated reality. As human beings, we navigate space with our bodies through movement and touch. The created figures are deconstructed to only perform these functions within their constructed place, relying on body language and form connection. Using dramatic light, shadow, and color, I push the plausibility of both the figure and its environment, yet they are painted in a brushy way to show how the illusion was created. This challenges the contrast between actuality and artificiality of our own bodies and those that are constructed.”
