		<p2 class = "artistBio"> An intuitive and moment-dependent way of working enables Heyn to playfully switch between various media. What is seen is reorganized and brought together again. New order through disorder of the usual. Heyn asked himself, “How do you like chaos?” and continued to say “I like cows, I guess they have a very calm and relaxed life. Ohh not cows, cars! Well I don’t have a driver’s license and I find them scary but practical. Hahahah ok now I got it CHAOS, in the beginning of everything I’m a fan of chaos. Thanks for that question!” You are quite welcome. </p2>
