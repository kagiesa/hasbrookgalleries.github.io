		<p2 class = "artistBio"> About the Work :: Bryant Girschâ€™s imagery is derived from his efforts to reconcile the personal experience of nature with a society that is digitally informed. While distanced from a landscape sensibility, he pursues unexpected explorations of natural subjects. A sense of discovery extends to his examination of digitalism as both a medium of perception and a reorganizing force. Relative orientation, rather than a universal whole, reflects a new manner of organizing digital structures and the systems they represent. Under this weight, all factors of the environment and experience coexist in a state of active interplay.
            As part of this art practice he examines his cultural identity and its relation to both nature and technology. By deconstructing these relationships, he creates new avenues he uses to enter and navigate their associated signifiers. In this state, networks of interweaving systems unravel. The resulting vantage point offers new perspectives from which to experience contemporary culture.
