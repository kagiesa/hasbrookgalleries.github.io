		<p2 class = "artistBio"> About the Work :: Martin Kačmarek (*1996, Spišská Nová Ves) is in his baccalaureate year in the
            STARTUP Studio in the Faculty of Visual Arts at the Academy of Arts in Banská Bystrica.
            He devotes himself primarily to airbrush painting, which he combines with acrylic or oil.
            Shapes, colours and textures fascinate him, and he also in large measure takes account
            of the principle of randomness. In a series of recent paintings he has turned aside from
            the digital medium and computer games as inspirations and gradually moved on to his
            natural fascination with the world of agriculture and DIY culture. Kačmarek’s monumental
            paintings are distinguished by an unconstrained painterly signature-style, which
            suppresses the ordinary aesthetic norms. Formless bodies and absurd portraits of fictive
            farmers result from his flat shapes and simple shading, mixed with humour, satire, irony,
            and a surrealist construction of the pictorial narrative.
