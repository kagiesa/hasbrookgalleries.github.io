		<p2 class = "artistBio"> About the Work :: The created characters are satires that allow for discussion on contemporary social issues such as stereotypes regarding masculinity, social integrity, ecology etc. The objects surrounding the main character support the evocation of given social concepts. Selected for their greater resonance in the collective imagination, they allow Vincent to shape the protagonist’s personality, highlighting how consumption can express belonging to various social groups. These objects are frequently human made, creating feelings of temporality and familiarity. This interpersonal concept goes further than Vincent’s point of view and refers also to metaperception, the perception an individual has regarding someone else’s perception towards themselves. </p2>
