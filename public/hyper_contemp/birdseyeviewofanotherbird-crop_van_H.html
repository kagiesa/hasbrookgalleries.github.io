		<p2 class = "artistBio"> About the Work :: Luke van Hâ€™s practice involves reconfiguration and transformation of a variety of internet detritus. Filtered through a love of gardening, and built up in photoshop, these images find synthesis in works that inhabit both the physical and digital space. The intention of the process is to capture the essence of and materialize digital drawings with works functioning as a fulcrum between the two agonizing worlds.
            The paintings inhabit a shifting space somewhere closely adjacent to our own realities. The paintings are produced in a series of meticulous, sequential steps, using digital drawing as a map. Thus the object becomes a distorted duplicate and mimicry of its digital originator, spawned from a digital plan. The painting becomes shut out from its other pixelated half, subject to the deterioration of time and space. </p2>
