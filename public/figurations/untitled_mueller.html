	<p2> About the Work :: This piece playfully engages with the idea of male vulnerability. He wanted to create tension with elements widely seen as soft and elements that carry a sense of harsh sharpness. It is as much a work of personal reflection, as it is a criticism of society’s expectations placed on gender. Working in a blue collar environment grants an unfiltered view of of how masculinity and fragility have become mutually exclusive concepts.  </p2>
