	<h2> Devon Hatton </h2>
	<h3> Graphite on Paper </h3>
	<h4> 8.25”x5.5” </h4>
	<p2> About the Work :: This piece of Devon’s is a vignette of intimacy that expose a battle between self-preservation and self-destruction.  She concentrates on the struggle of uncontrollable mental illness and invisible burdens in day-to-day life. Her obsessive and repetitive methods of drawing act as therapy- a purging of silent afflictions. The drawings become recurring ghost images weaving in and out of reality- a mixture of clarity and confusion with the figure and space sometimes becoming a single entity. Empathy and familiarity play an important role, as the discussion of internal battles is both universal and extremely private.
