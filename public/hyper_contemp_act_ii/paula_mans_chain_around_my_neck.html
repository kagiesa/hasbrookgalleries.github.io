		<p2 class = "artistBio">Paula Mans tells the many stories of the global Black experience
      through collage. The artist views collage as emblematic of the
      cultural and historical interconnectedness of the African Diaspora.
      Just as the dispersed people of the African Diaspora are tied together
      by the common thread of ancestry, in collage, small, seemingly
      disjointed pieces are fused to communicate one story. In her analog
      collage works, Paula draws from portrait photography of people from
      across the Diaspora – cutting, deconstructing, layering, bonding, and
      resignifying small parts to assemble new faces and forms that
      communicate identity and shared experiences.
      Paula Mans creates figurative collages that engage in visual discourse
      surrounding the (in)visibility and agency of people of African
      descent. The artist’s prominent figures are rendered in seemingly
      mythic proportions, commanding attention and expressing authority. The
      works subvert notions of power through the Gaze. Rather than being
      images to be viewed and consumed, the figures look defiantly out onto
      the world and the viewer. The figures that the artist constructs do
      more than simply exist. They resist and insist.
      Paula Mans frequently uses monochrome throughout her work, employing a
      range of gray and black tones to express the rich pigments of Black
      skin. The figures are often cast against stark, bold, and textured
      backgrounds. This heightened contrast plays with notions of
      (in)visibility. Traditionally a two-dimensional medium, Paula Mans
      inserts textural abstraction and textiles into her collages, lending a
      sculptural and painterly quality to her mixed-media analog works.Paula Mans (b. 1986) is a self-taught
      painter, collagist, and art
      educator based in Washington, DC. While Paula is a native
      Washingtonian, she spent many of the formative years of her childhood
      and young adulthood living abroad in Tanzania, Mozambique, Eswatini,
      and Brazil. Her experiences throughout the African Diaspora shaped her
      identity and informed the development of her artistic voice. Living in
      Washington, DC and Salvador, Brazil has been particularly impactful
      for the artist. Both cities are diasporic meccas for Black cultural
      expression. DC (often referred to as Chocolate City) and Salvador
      (sometimes called Roma Negra, or Black Rome in Portuguese) are famous
      for their prominent and influential Black populations. Nonetheless,
      racism and gentrification often render Black people invisible in both
      cities. Paula Mans seeks to critically address these pervasive power
      structures by amplifying the visibility and agency of the Black figure
      in her artistic practice. Her work has been curated into group shows
      in Washington, DC, Baltimore, and New York. </p2>
